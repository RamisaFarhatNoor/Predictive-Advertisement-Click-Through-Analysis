# Predictive-Advertisement-Click-Through-Analysis
## Overview
This project involves the development of a predictive model to determine whether a user, based on various demographic and behavioral factors, is likely to click on an online advertisement. The model uses Logistic Regression and features such as age, gender, location, and internet usage to make predictions, assisting businesses in targeting their advertising efforts more effectively and efficiently.


## Features

This predictive model utilizes a variety of features to determine whether a user is likely to click on an online advertisement. These features include:

- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: The amount of time a user spends on the website daily (in minutes).

- **Age**: The user's age.

- **Area Income**: The income level of the user's area.

- **Daily Internet Usage**: The amount of time a user spends on the internet daily (in minutes).

- **City**: The city in which the user resides.

- **Gender**: The gender of the user (0 for male, 1 for female, for example).

- **Country**: The user's country of residence, such as USA in this example.

These features are used as inputs to the predictive model, allowing it to make informed predictions about whether a user will click on an ad.
